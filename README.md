The data for this analysis is acquired from https://www.citibikenyc.com/ 
data of 2019-Jan-Mar-Apr-Jul and 2020 -Jan-Mar-Apr-Jul are merged and cleaned using pandas 
Data frames are converted in to 2019 csv and 2020csv files
each file had more than 6 million records
the inference from the data collected is as follows

There are more male users than female users
maximum users of the Citi bike services are in the age group of 25 to 33 years
peak hours of operation are 7:30 am to 9:30 am and 4:00pm to 8:00pm
highest occurring trip duration stations are in Midtown Manhattan, Downtown Manhattan and there are two zip codes (zip code 11215 and zip code 11225)
that are situated at the Prospect Park and also happen to be where the Citi bike services end point (or a starting point) which has the highest trip durations occurring in the range of 40 million
we also got the top 10 starting stations and bottom 10 start stations
station with highest traffic start point is West St. and Chambers St. station
